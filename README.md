# Brain-Age-Helsa


In this project, we aim to calculate the Brain Age Gap with traditional Machine Learning algorithms.

To achieve the goal, here are several steps to use this projects:

1. Running the Fastsurfer file, copy them to the commomd--Linux prompt.
2. Idealy the features are stored in a .txt file.
3. Now browsing the entire folder's structure, to check the path of the dataset, feature file, and demongraphic file.
4. Running the Machien Learning Algorithms: Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, Supportvector, Randomforests
5. Check the results! Also, MAE values are provided.
